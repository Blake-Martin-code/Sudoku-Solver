# Sudoku-Solver
This a python program that solves a sudoku board using backtracking.
Simply download the python file and you are ready to run the program and solve some sudoku boards.
There is a randomize sudoku board method that allows you to randomize a sudoku board (pleast note: this randomize method sometimes produces boards that are unsolvable since it is possible to have an unsolvable board in sudoku)
Further more you can by hand add your sudoku numbers to the blank board that is already in the file. In the future I will be adding a board generator that reads in from a file and creates a board so that is is much easier to insert your own custom boards.
